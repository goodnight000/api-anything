const HELP: Record<string, string> = {
  login: `api-anything login <site|url> [--profile "Chrome/Profile 1"] [--window] [--cookies <file>]
  By default imports the site's cookies from your everyday browser (you are almost always already
  signed in there, so no password and no re-doing 2FA). Prints which profile was used and the cookie
  NAMES only (plus the profile's display name and Google account). The imported session is the SAME
  one as your browser: if the site logs it out, both go.
  <site|url>  a site name (linkedin), a domain (linkedin.com, www.linkedin.com) or a URL
  --profile   the browser profile to import from, e.g. "Chrome/Profile 1". Needed when several
              profiles are signed in to the site (possibly different people's accounts): login
              then lists them with their names and emails instead of guessing. The choice is
              remembered: a later automatic re-import uses the same profile.
  --window    open a visible browser window to sign in by hand (an independent session); also the
              automatic fallback when nothing is importable. This is where you solve 2FA/captchas.
              It counts only if a login cookie appears or changes while it is open; else ok:false
              and the stored session is kept.
  --cookies   import a cookies.txt (Netscape) or JSON export (Cookie-Editor / Playwright), for CI
  Output: loggedIn, renewed (new login cookies), and a warning when the cookies show no sign-in or
  are the ones the session already had. Cookies every signed-out visitor gets never count.`,
  logout: `api-anything logout <site>
  Clears the stored cookie jar and this site's cookies in api-anything's browser profile.`,
  capture: `api-anything capture <url> [--steps <json>] [--soft-from <url>] [--example k=v]... [--write] [--limit n] [--outline]
  Loads the page in the browser and lists the requests it made, noise filtered and ranked (requests carrying
  the --example values first). Saves everything as a capture id for: add --from <id> --pick-request <n>,
  and for: inspect <id> <n>. Captures hold cookie values; the newest 20 are kept, none past 24 h.
  --steps      JSON array of {action: click|fill|press|wait|goto, selector?, value?, ms?}
  --soft-from  load this page first, then navigate in-app to <url> (SPAs only fire their data XHRs that way)
  --write      abort every non-GET request, and every xhr/fetch sent during --steps, before it leaves the browser.
               Without it, a POST, PUT, PATCH or DELETE sent once the steps run is stopped too (a GraphQL query
               passes): the page loads as usual, and a click that would place an order places none
  --outline    for the top 3 candidates, summarize the response instead of making you inspect it: where the
               example values are, a suggested --extract and --pick fields with samples, JSON the page
               embeds (a ready --embedded regex), and a repeated HTML list as a ready --html recipe
  Output: capture (the id), candidates, next (what to do). blocked: the bot challenge the site served.
  pageStatus: the page's own HTTP error, when a request it loaded is recommended all the same.
  stopped: the requests the steps sent that were stopped without --write (method and path); nothing was sent.`,
  inspect: `api-anything inspect <captureId> [<requestId>] [--extract <path>] [--pick a,b] [--html <json>] [--embedded <regex>] [--outline] [--example k=v]
  No browser. Without a request id, lists every request in the capture. With one, shows its request and
  response through add's recipe flags, so a recipe is tried here first: --extract (also spelled --path),
  --pick, --html, --embedded. A path, selector or regex that finds nothing fails (exit 1). An empty
  list at a path is a result, and so is an --html items selector "<container> <item>" whose container
  is on the page with no item in it (data: [], with a note).
  --outline summarizes the response (as capture --outline does) instead of printing it.
  A request's URL and body show the run's cookie and storage values as refs ([cookie:x]), except
  one equal to an --example value.`,
  add: `api-anything add <site> <op> --trigger <url-template> --example k=v [--example2 k=v] [options]
  Runs the trigger twice in the browser (with --example, then --example2 or --example again), picks the request
  carrying the example values, and saves the learned operation to ~/.api-anything/sites/<site>.json.
  --trigger       page URL with {param} placeholders, e.g. https://site.com/u/{name}
  --steps <json>  UI steps after load, [{action: click|fill|press|wait|goto, selector?, value?, ms?}];
                  {param} is filled in selector/value
  --soft-from     neutral page to load first, then navigate in-page to the trigger
  --match k=v     pin the request: method=, host=, path= (* = one segment), operationName= (or JSON).
                  Without --write, a POST, PUT, PATCH or DELETE the steps send is stopped unless it is this
                  one (or a GraphQL query), and one on the page's own site fails the add before run 2
  --from <id> --pick-request <n>   learn from a saved capture instead of running the trigger (no browser).
                  Every add saves its own runs as captures, so a wrong recipe is fixed this way: add the op
                  again --from the capture it was learned from, with the recipe flags (--extract, --pick,
                  --html, --embedded). With no --example the op's stored examples are used, so the capture
                  must carry them; from a capture made with other values, pass those with --example
  --from2 <id>    a second capture, made with the --example2 values, for the two-run diff; with --from,
                  --example2 needs it: capture the page again with those values
  --extract <path>  dot/bracket path into the response; [*] collects from every array item (sections[*].items)
  --pick a,b.c,name=x.y  fields kept per item; name=path renames the key, name=path~regex keeps regex group 1
  --html <json>   {"items":"<css>","fields":{"name":"<css>[@attr]"}} for server-rendered pages;
                  "all:<css>[@attr]" returns every match as a list (genres, tags); "empty":"<css>" names the
                  element a page with no results shows instead of the list, so such a page answers []
  --embedded <regex>  JSON inside the page: group 1 marks where the JSON value starts; then --extract
  --public <name,...>  a header, or a credential-like field such as api_key, whose value is the same for every
                  visitor (a web app's bearer): kept literal unless the value is in a cookie or the page's
                  storage. A per-session field (token, csrf) stays a reference. Only when it is not the user's
  --write         the op changes state: it is learned from intercepted, aborted requests only. A request a
                  --write capture aborted, or an existing write learned again, needs --write: neither is
                  ever saved as a read
  --description <text>  what the op is for; an op added again with no --example keeps the one it had ("" clears it)
  --enum name=a,b,c  the values a param takes: the site's whole set (its picker's options), not only the
                  example's; a call with another is refused as input, and nothing is sent
  --min name=n, --max name=n  bounds on a param's value read as a number (a page, a count, a price)
  --paging <param>[=<path>]  a read whose list pages: <param> takes the next page, and <path> (in the
                  whole response, before --extract) is where the response gives the next page's cursor,
                  which a call returns as nextPage (hasMore false: the site said there is no next page).
                  Without =<path> the pages are numbered, and a call says nothing about the next one.
                  The param must be in the request: to page by a cursor, learn the op from the request
                  that loads page 2 ("Show more"), so the cursor is a param
                  An op learned again keeps its params' allowed values and descriptions, its checks,
                  its paging and its readback.
  Output: preview (what a call returns, from the captured response), warnings (read them), captures.
  replaced: an op of that name was learned again. unproven: example 2 was answered with example 1's
  data, or (example 2 changing several params of a read) one of them sent alone in example 1's args was,
  so nothing shows the server reads those params (publish refuses the op until it does).
  An op whose captured response is a bot challenge, a sign-in page, a rate limit or a server failure
  is not saved.`,
  call: `api-anything call <site> <op> [k=v ...] [--json <args-object>] [--allow-writes] [--again] [--idempotency-key <k>] [--max-tier 1|2|3] [--force] [--dry]
  Calls an operation: {ok, class, data, tier, healed?, heal?, ms, next?}; a failure also says retry
  (safe, after_wait, after_fix, no), retryAfterMs and nextCall, and a write says write (not_sent,
  not_applied, accepted, may_have_applied, applied: its readback found it). A paged read says
  nextPage (pass it as the op's paging param) and hasMore. A call that healed the op says how and
  what changed in its request in heal (undo: api-anything revert <site> <op>). --dry prints the
  request with credentials redacted.
  --again          send a write refused as a duplicate (the same args within 10 minutes, and the
                    first may have gone through): only when the user checked the site
  --idempotency-key <k>  on the first call: a repeat of the write with the same key returns that
                    call's record (added only to a retry, the retry is still a duplicate)
  --force           send even while the site cools down: after a rate limit (its Retry-After, or
                    3 minutes) or a block at every tier (10 minutes) calls answer without sending.
                    A forced call that succeeds ends the wait; one limited or blocked again starts
                    it over. A login for the site also ends the wait`,
  verify: `api-anything verify [site]
  Calls every read operation with its stored example args and its checks, healing as needed, and
  judges each case: pass, fail, or inconclusive (a challenge, a sign-in page, a rate limit, or a server
  that failed or could not be reached: it says nothing about the op). The outcomes are kept per op, for
  publish. An op marked unproven loses the mark when two passing cases that differ only in its
  unproven params answer differently. A paged read also asks for the page after its example's
  ("next page"): an answer with only page 1's items again fails.`,
  check: `api-anything check <site> <op> [k=v ...] --expect result|empty|input [--purpose <text>]
  Records a check on a read: args a human confirmed on the site, and what the site answers them with
  (result: data; empty: no data, the site's own no-results; input: the site refuses the args). verify
  runs it; publish refuses while one fails, and shares the checks with the spec, so use only public
  values. Choose values that exclude something: an empty check (a filter no row passes) shows a param
  the server ignores. A check with the same args replaces the old one; remove one by editing the spec.`,
  readback: `api-anything readback <site> <write-op> <read-op> [k=v ...] [--find <field>=<value>]
  How a write's call proves it landed: after the write is sent and accepted (or may have run), the
  call runs <read-op> once with these args (a read, never a second send). Finding it makes the
  call's write "applied"; not finding it changes nothing (the site may show it later). A value may
  be {param}, filled from the write's args: list={list}. --find title={title}: an item of the read's
  result whose title equals the write's; without --find, any data counts. Use something only this
  write makes (a title the caller chose, an id), or an older item can pass for it. Replaces the op's
  readback; remove one by editing the spec.`,
  sites: `api-anything sites
  Lists known sites (user specs in ~/.api-anything/sites win over bundled ones).`,
  ops: `api-anything ops <site>
  Lists a site's operations and params (with each param's format), and the site's notes: caveats,
  arg formats and login advice from <site>.md beside its spec.`,
  heal: `api-anything heal <site> <op> [k=v ...]
  Forces a heal (rescan, then recapture) even when the op is marked stale. Reads only.`,
  heals: `api-anything heals [site]
  Lists the last 20 heals and reverts (of one site, or all), newest first: when, which op, how (rescan,
  recapture, revert) and what changed in its request template, one line each, with {param} and
  cookie:/session: refs in place of values. A call that heals says the same in its heal field.`,
  status: `api-anything status [site]
  What this machine knows of each op's health, from local files only (nothing is sent): a site's
  cool-down, an op's stale mark, the tier calls start at (remembered) beside the op's own (minTier),
  its last heal, its last verify outcome, its writes of the last 24 h by what each did, and from the
  call log (calls.jsonl, a week kept) the calls of the last 24 h and 7 days: count, ok rate, tiers,
  heals, median ms, and the last call's class. degraded: the last 24 h ran at a higher tier, or with
  an ok rate 20 points lower, than the 6 days before. problems lists each one with its next step.
  Without a site: every site with something on record here.`,
  revert: `api-anything revert <site> <op>
  Puts back the op as it was before its last heal (heals.jsonl keeps it), and logs the revert; run it
  again to take back the heal before that. Refused when the op has no heal to take back, or changed
  after it (learned again or edited). A pulled spec's copy keeps its shared record, and the op gets back
  the registry version it was. The next call sends the old request: if the site really changed, it
  drifts and may heal again, so learn the op again with add if the heal was wrong.`,
  export: `api-anything export <site> [--out <file>] [--keep-examples] [--force]
  Writes a shareable spec: examples and response shapes stripped, and refused if a live cookie or
  session value is inside. --keep-examples keeps param examples you confirmed are public (so verify works).`,
  search: `api-anything search <words | domain | url>
  Finds sites someone already turned into operations: the shared registry and the specs on this
  machine, best match first, each op with its params and its status in the registry. Words match a
  site's name, its description and what its operations do and return ("book ratings"); a domain or a
  URL matches the sites whose operations use it (news.ycombinator.com). Each match says whether it is
  installed; pull one that is not. A match may list the site's own agent interfaces (an MCP server, an
  OpenAPI document); a domain search finds a site that has only those. API_ANYTHING_REGISTRY overrides
  the registry's URL.`,
  interface: `api-anything interface mcp|openapi <url>
  Tells the registry a site offers its own agent interface: an MCP server or an OpenAPI document, https
  on the site's own domain. Once installs on enough distinct networks said so, search lists it beside
  the site's operations, and a domain search finds a site that has only it. Signed with this install's
  key; nothing else is sent.`,
  pull: `api-anything pull <site>
  Fetches a site someone shared from the registry into ~/.api-anything/registry, so you can call it
  without learning it. Someone else wrote it: it is checked against the shared rules first, and its
  writes still need --allow-writes. Prints each op (method, hosts, write, login, status) and the
  warnings a human should read; a pull again names what changed. API_ANYTHING_REGISTRY overrides the
  registry's URL.`,
  publish: `api-anything publish <site> [op ...] [--yes]
  Shares the ops of a site you learned (all of them, or the ones named) with the registry, so others
  can call them instead of learning the site again. Without --yes it only previews: exactly what each
  upload sends, what was stripped, the warnings, and what may be yours (an email, an account id, a
  literal typed into the page). The param examples are sent: they must be values anyone may see. It
  refuses an op holding a live cookie or session value, or failing its checks. --yes sends them, signed
  with this install's key; an op that needed a login or writes is reviewed before others get it.`,
  mcp: `api-anything mcp [--allow-writes] [--sites a,b] [--print-config] [--no-learn]
  Serves list_sites, find_sites, list_operations, call_operation, get_job, site_status, login and learn_site over
  stdio MCP, and call_write_operation with --allow-writes. list_operations and call_operation pull a
  shared site an agent asks for, with its reads only: its writes need a human's api-anything pull. Its
  login only refreshes a session a human imported here. A call still running after about 25 s answers
  class pending with a job, which get_job waits for. With sharing on, an idle server checks a few new
  shared operations a day, over plain HTTP with no cookies, and reports how calls went. learn_site
  learns a read (as learn does); writes are learned here with add --write.
  --sites a,b     also serve each operation of these sites as a tool of its own (goodreads__searchBooks),
                  with its args' JSON Schema: no list_operations step first. Costs tokens per op
  --print-config  print the command or config entry that adds this server to Claude Code, Codex,
                  Gemini CLI, VS Code, Cursor and Claude Desktop, with absolute paths and the other
                  flags given, instead of serving
  --no-learn      hide learn_site`,
  setup: `api-anything setup [--yes | --no-share] [--share-only] [--agents claude-code,codex,cursor,claude-desktop] [--dry-run]
  Connects the MCP server (npx -y api-anything mcp) to each agent found on this machine: Claude Code,
  Codex, Cursor, Claude Desktop. Installs the skill for Claude Code (~/.claude/skills) and Codex
  (~/.agents/skills). Checks for a Chromium browser, makes this install's key, and asks whether to help
  build the shared catalog (default yes). Other entries in an agent's config are never changed; a file
  is backed up to <file>.bak-api-anything before its first edit. Running it again changes nothing.
  --yes        share: answer the question yes without asking
  --no-share   do not share; answer the question no
  --share-only record --yes or --no-share and nothing else: no agent, skill or key is touched. learn_site
               asks the question the first time something could be shared; this records the answer
               given in chat, and changes it later
  --agents     connect these agents only, found or not
  --dry-run    print what would change, and change nothing`,
  learn: `api-anything learn <trigger> --args k=v --args2 k=v --args3 k=v [--site s] [--op o] [--intent text] [options]
  Learns a read in one step and returns the answer to --args (as MCP learn_site does): runs the page with
  --args and --args2, picks the request carrying them and the fields from the first run's outline, saves
  the op with --args2 as its example, calls it with --args3 (kept as the op's check) and once with no
  cookies, then shares it when sharing is on and it is public. A login op is shared only on your yes.
  First, when the registry has a read for the same page on that domain, it calls that with --args and
  answers with reused: no browser, nothing learned (--fresh, a recipe or --from learns anyway).
  <trigger>   page URL with {param} placeholders, e.g. https://site.com/search?q={q}
  --args      the values you want the answer for
  --args2     another real value of the same kind (the op's shared example)
  --args3     a third, different from both (the holdout check)
  --from <id> --from2 <id>   learn again from an earlier learn's captures, with no browser
  --fresh     learn the page even when a shared op answers for it (its data was not what you wanted)
  --pick-request <n>, --extract, --pick, --html, --embedded   choose the request and the recipe (see add)
  Output: data, signature, chosen and alternatives (request and recipe), proof, shared; or data and reused.`,
